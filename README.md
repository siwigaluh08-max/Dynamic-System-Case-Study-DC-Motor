In the simulation implementation, the program was given input in the form of a 5 Volt pulse voltage signal that was active for a duration of 5 s ( from the 1st to the 6th s), and then the experiment was repeated with a negative voltage of -5 Volts to verify the motor response in the opposite direction of rotation. The final result of this simulation must be visualized in the form of a response against time that displays three main variables: Motor Torque, Angular Speed, and Back EMF voltage. In addition, a parameter analysis was conducted to identify the physical variables that were the most dominant in slowing down the motor response time towards a stable speed condition (steady-state).
